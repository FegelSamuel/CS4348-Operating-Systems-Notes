# Conservation of Energy
The **conservation of energy method** states that the total mechanical energy (**kinetic energy** + **potential energy**) of a system remains constant if there are no non-conservative forces (like friction or air resistance) acting on it.

### Step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial Energy (at height h):**
   - The box starts at a height **h** above the ground, so its initial potential energy is:
     
     $\[
     PE_{\text{initial}} = Mgh
     $\]
   

     where **M** is the mass of the box, **g** is the acceleration due to gravity, and **h** is the height.

   - Initially, the box is at rest (if we assume no initial velocity), so its initial kinetic energy is:
     $\[
     KE_{\text{initial}} = 0
     $\]

2. **Final Energy (at the bottom of the incline):**
   - At the end of the incline, the box is at ground level, so its final potential energy is:
     $\[
     PE_{\text{final}} = 0
     $\]
   - The box now has a velocity **v**, so its final kinetic energy is:
     $\[
     KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} Mv^2
     $\]

3. **Conservation of Energy:**
   The total mechanical energy at the top and bottom must be equal, meaning:
   $\[
   PE_{\text{initial}} + KE_{\text{initial}} = PE_{\text{final}} + KE_{\text{final}}
   $\]
   Substituting the values:
   $\[
   Mgh + 0 = 0 + \frac{1}{2} Mv^2
   $\]
   Simplifying:
   $\[
   Mgh = \frac{1}{2} Mv^2
   $\]
   Cancel out **M** from both sides (since **M** != 0):
   $\[
   gh = \frac{1}{2} v^2
   $\]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   $\[
   2gh = v^2
   $\]
   Taking the square root of both sides:
   $\[
   v = \sqrt{2gh}
   $\]

### Final Answer:
The velocity of the box at the end of the inclined plane is:
$\[
v = \sqrt{2gh}
$\]
